idonethis-alfred
================

Allows users of Alfred 2 to post their Dones directly to IDoneThis.com via their favorite tool, Alfred.

There is currently not an API to talk to IDoneThis.com, however an email interface does exist. To utilize this extension you will currently need to setup a PHP file on a webserver that will act as an email proxy.
